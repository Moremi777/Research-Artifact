9-Lucky the Fish

Lucky the fish was swimming home from school.
He received a new text message and said, "How cool!"
As he read the message on his phone,
He saw the message was sent from "Unknown".
He got very excited as he read,
"Wow! I have won a prize", Lucky said.

Sunny the starfish was playing nearby
And came over to Lucky to say "Hi".
Lucky shows the message to his friend Sunny,
But instead of being excited, Sunny said: "How funny".
Lucky told him, "I must just click in this link,
Then I get my prize. What do you think?"
"No!" said Sunny, "This is not wise.
Do you know the number? Did you enter for the prize?"

Lucky said, "I did not enter a competition, no.
But I am a lucky fish, you know".

"I know you are lucky", Sunny said, "but listen to me,
Nobody just gives away prizes for free.
There is no prize - it is a trick,
Bad guys will infect your phone as soon as you click.
They may give you a virus, or steal your information,
They can even track you down and find your location!
Never reply to any message or e-mail from a stranger,
It will most certainly put you in danger."

"Wow!" said Lucky, "Thank you for helping me.
Strangers are dangerous. On the phone and in the sea."

So Lucky deleted the message and remained protected.
His identity was safe and his phone not infected.

Moral:
Do not access or respond to unknown and suspicious messages.

Question: Is it a good thing that Lucky told his friend Sunny about the message?

Question: Can Lucky experience the same situation when he is on his computer?
