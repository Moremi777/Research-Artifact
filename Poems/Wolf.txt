6-Wolf, Hyena and Fox

One, two, three, four
Are passwords you should not use anymore
Wolf, Hyena and their friend Fox
Are making a new password by using rocks

Big, small, round or flat
Are combinations hard to hack
So by using capitals, numbers, exclamations marks and more
Will stop intruders entering your online door

Wolf tells Hyena “We must help set the password for our friends;
If we have their passwords, think how much fun we can have!”

Hyena laughs because he thinks it’s a good idea
They can access friends’ profiles
And find personal information to see.
But Fox is smart and warns everyone –
“Remember when you create a password,
You must tell no one!”

Moral
Make sure your password are strong and not easy to guess.

Question: Where do these rules also apply in real life?
