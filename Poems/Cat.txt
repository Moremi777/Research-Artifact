6-Cyber Cat

There was a cat a Cyber Cat
Who wore a very tall black and white hat
He went online to play online
And did a little this and a little that

He was very good and got much better
To enter restricted sites
To gain entrance to these he will type
Script into a few coded lines

From good to better, hard became easy, and Cyber Cat went in everywhere
He got into banks and sent lots of money to his family and friends
Cyber Cat did in fact steal and this is a crime
So with his black and white hat, Cyber Cat had to do some time

Moral:
Hacking is an example of illegal online activities, there are consequences for illegal actions.

Question: What other illegal online activities are there?

Question: When you suspect someone you know is doing the same, what can you do about it?
