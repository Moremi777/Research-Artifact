8-Elephant and his shoe

Rabbit had a good friend, Elephant
Who could not tie his shoe
Although he had such a long trunk
He still did not know what to do

So Elephant invited Rabbit to his house
High-high up on a hill with a tree
Elephants have big bodies –
So they need lots of space with lots to see!

Elephant knows Rabbit is good with gadgets
And that he visits the internet on his very smart tablet.
Rabbit can Google how to tie a shoe
And hopefully show Elephant what he must do.

Living on the hill provides for a very good signal in most places
And now Rabbit can use the internet to help Elephant tie his laces.
Although Elephant could not tie his shoe he is smarter than he 
looks,
For he uses his parents’ Kindle to access electronic books.

To thank Rabbit he offered him his parents’ device
But Rabbit said no, even if the offer was really nice
He wants to go outside and play in the grass
Playing with friends is much nicer than playing with electronic glass.

Moral
The internet is very useful, but it is just as healthy to play outside with friends!

Question: What is Google?

Question: Why is it healthy to be outside with friends and family?
