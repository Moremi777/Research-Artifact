4-Rabbit with the Tablet

There was a tiny Rabbit
With a very fancy tablet
He wanted to play games on it
For it was a very smart gadget

The tablet could go onto the internet
And visit many online sites,
Some of them were not so pretty
So he got a very big fright!

The Rabbit had little Monkey friends And
they also wanted to play,
But because of all the choices on the internet
On the safe sites they would not stay.

Little Rabbit was not sure what to do
Because mommy would be mad â€“
Going into dangerous online sites
Is not very safe, is it very bad.

The parents and the teachers are careful of the tablets
And all their possibilities for wrong and right,
The entire animal community that has access to these gadgets
Must work together to secure it from online frights!

Moral:
Be careful and safe when visiting online websites.

Question: Are all online websites bad?

Question: What are the positive aspects of the internet?
